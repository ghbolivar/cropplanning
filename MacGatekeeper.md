# Introduction #

In MacOS 10.8, Apple changed the way they handle newly downloaded programs.  Apps that aren't "signed" (a digital signature often used to verify that an app is from who it says it's from) are said to be damaged even though there's nothing wrong with them.  CropPlanning is not signed and this message will appear for new users of the app that use MacOS 10.8.

There are instructions at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58086, but the short version is:

  1. Open "System Preferences"
  1. Select "Security and Privacy"
  1. Change the setting for "Allow applications downloaded from:" to "Anywhere".  You might have to click the padlock icon in the bottom left of the window first.
  1. Try opening the CropPlanning app again.

Sorry for this inconvenience.  We are looking at ways to work around this.
