  * [Crop Planning Spreadsheets](http://www.brookfieldfarm.org/cps.html) by Dan Kaplan at [Brookfield Farm](http://www.brookfieldfarm.org/) in Amherst, MA.
_Hundreds, if not thousands, of diversified farms use these spreadsheets for CSA and crop planning, field mapping and seed ordering.  They are also the inspiration for this software project._

_We haven't yet used it, but it seems like a great way to keep your planting, seeding and harvest notes from smudging and running when they're actually in use in the field or greenhouse._

_This project is funded in part by a grant from USDA-SARE.  None of this work would have happened without this funding.  (Well, it might have happened, but it would have taken MUCH longer that it has.)_

_They have provided us with invaluable support and feedback for this project._
