# Plea #

As a _free and open source_ project, we depend upon your help to keep this going and make it better.  Without funding, development will not be able to proceed.  Please help out!

With _free and open source_ software, it's important to think about donations as pledges of support rather than purchases of products.  Don't think that you're purchasing an incomplete piece of software, think of it instead as you pledging to help complete that software knowing all the while that you (and the rest of world) will reap the benefits in the near future.

In addition to **warm, fuzzy feelings**, donors have access to **priority email support**.

# Make Donations #

We accept donations through [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com), which allows you to donate with a credit or debit card if you don't have a PayPal account, or right from your bank account if you do.

If you use the buttons below, you will be taken to the PayPal website where you will be able to send a donation directly to me (Clayton Carter, lead developer of the Crop Planning Software project) via the email address `crcarter@alumni.indiana.edu`.  Aside from the small processing fee charged to us by PayPal (approx. 6% for $10 donations, ~4% for $25, and ~3% for $100), all of your money will go to fund work on this software: developing new features, fixing bugs, creating documentation and such.

**_Please note_** that donations to this project are **not** tax deductible.
