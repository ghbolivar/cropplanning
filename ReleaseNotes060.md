Release Notes for Version 0.6.0<br>
<br>
<h2>WARNING</h2>

This software is being released in a "beta" state.  This means that<br>
the software may be finicky or unpredictable.  Please use this version<br>
but do expect some bumps along the way.  <b>Back up your data files frequently!</b>


<h2>Major New Features</h2>

<h3>New Layout</h3>

All new under-the-hood layout means the program will still look familiar, but will behave like other programs when it's resized.  The divider between the top and bottom parts can now be drug up and down to expand or show more of the table.  Text fields no longer collapse if input is too large.  Notes fields moved around and enlarged.<br>
<br>
<h3>Metric support!</h3>

Danke!  Prego!<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>New module: "PlanStats"</h3>

Calculates beds in use by week per field, flats in the greenhouse per week, how many beds or rowfeet (or meters!) are tagged as needing "requirements" or inputs and how many flats/trays are needed by size.  (As for "requirements", think "plastic mulch", "drip tape", "reemay", etc.  This depends on the new "Weeks of Harvest" datum exposed for Crops and Plantings.<br>
<br>
<h3>Better Windows Support</h3>

Windows version is now all wrapped up in itself and can be moved around w/o breaking things â€¦ FINALLY!!  (The .exe file can be moved to your desktop, Program Files, or any other folder and it will work just the same.)  There is now a third release package just for those of you (Hi, Linux!) not using Mac or Windows.  (Before, the Linux and Windows versions were bundled together.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Other New and Noteworthy Changes</h2>


<ul><li>New users will have a crop, variety and planting created for them when they first start the program.  I hope this will make the program a little easier to understand for new users.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Improved "notes" mechanism for plantings and crops/vars.  You can jot down observations from this year or ideas for improvements for next year, or just notes to keep track of.  Also improved the layout and entry of notes that get displayed on the planting lists; they should be easier to read in the program now.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Auto-Update function will now remember if you clicked "skip this version".</li></ul>

<ul><li>New export list: "harvest availability" generates a table of when crops will be available for harvest.  Useful for planning as well as showing buyers what they might expect from you and when.  Also, added harvest date to the "All Plantings" export, and added raw seed count to the "Seed Order Worksheet".</li></ul>

<ul><li>The cells in the table can once again be edited, and the table will sort on the numerical order of the values, not the alphanumerical value.  (Whoops!)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Keywords and Groups should now be inherited from crops to plantings.  Also, plantings can now be filtered/searched on crop family (if any was entered in the cropDB)</li></ul>

<ul><li>Bugfixes:<br>
<ul><li>Plantings wouldn't save changes if the only change was wether it was DS or TP.<br>
</li><li>Components should behave much more consistently when no record is displayed, a record is selected or different values need to be highlighted or displayed.<br>
</li><li>seed quants were being calculated w/o the fudge factor</li></ul></li></ul>


<h2>Plans for Next Version</h2>

<ul><li>functional import/export to/from CSV format for spreadsheet users<br>
</li><li>group plantings together on the planting lists and display more relevant, less repetitive information many plantings of the same crop<br>
</li><li>some sort of support for creating and managing succession plantings<br>
</li><li>you tell us what we should be working on: cropplanning@gmail.com</li></ul>
