# Crop Planning Software #

**Crop Planning Software** for small farmers and serious gardeners.  Plan for and manage the myriad crops, varieties and plantings required to keep a modern, intensive market garden producing throughout the growing season.  This is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Unix, etc) desktop application that allows small farmers and gardeners to:  Create, duplicate and delete crops and plantings; inherit data from other plantings and crops; key in a few data and let the program calculate the rest for you; sort and filter your plantings.  These are all possible and new features are being added all the time.  The software has been released as **open source, free software** and therefore is and will always be available **free of charge**.  Those who **donate**, however, will be thanked profusely.

### Features ###

  * familiar, spreadsheet-like interface
  * easily create and print **weekly field planting** and **GH seeding lists**
  * **sort** and **filter** your crop plans so you only see _what you **want to see**_
  * powerful database makes it easier to work with your plans and keep data _linked together_
  * easily keep track of whether something has been **planted, transplanted and harvested**
  * easily keep track of the **actual** _and_ **planned dates** upon which  something is planted, transplanted and harvested
  * data can be "**linked**" from crops ==> varieties ==> individual plantings
  * enter certain values and have others calculated automatically; for example:
    * enter a **number of beds or row-feet** to plant and the program can calculate **how many transplants** you'll need
    * enter a desired **yield quantity** and the program can tell you how many **row-feet or beds** you should plant
    * enter your desired **date of harvest** and the program can estimate **when to plant**
  * import & export data
  * **bed and row** lengths can be set for every field or even for every bed
  * Missed a planting?  Don't delete it, just _ignore_ it (ie, "skip" it) to get it out of the way.
  * Plantings can be explicitly marked as **direct seeded** or **transplanted** and can have different planting data accordingly.
  * Help you estimate **how much seed** you'll need to execute your plan
  * Support for US and **metric** measurements
  * **charts and stats** that show:
    * **beds in use** in each field by week
    * **trays in the greenhouse** by week
    * how many **trays needed** (tallied up by size) for the season
    * how many beds have "requirements" (ie, black plastic, reemay, etc) for the season
